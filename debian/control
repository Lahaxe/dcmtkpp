Description: C++ wrapper library for the DCMTK DICOM toolkit
 DCMTK++ is a C++ wrapper library for DCMTK, a C++ toolkit handling the DICOM
 medical imaging standard. DCMTK++ leverages C++ constructs to provide a
 more user-friendly API, notably for the networking part. Included in
 DCMTK++ are exception-based error handling, generic access to datasets
 elements, standard JSON representation of datasets, and generic
 implementation of messages, clients and servers for the various DICOM
 protocols.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.
